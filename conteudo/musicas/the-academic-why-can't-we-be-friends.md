Don't leave me here, especially not with her
Não me deixe aqui, especialmente não com ela

You've heard of people getting lost


Here we don't even talk
Don't drink my fear
When I've had too much
You've heard of people getting lost
I wanna see you in the dark
And it falls and it breaks and it turns into something new
I say don't let me go
And you say why can't we be friends
All night I watch it burn
And you say why can't we be friends
Talk to me and tell me how this one goes
I need a taxi
This world is pointless
If you're not here
This world is pointless
If we're not self-destructing love
And it falls and it breaks and it turns into something new
And it falls and it breaks and it turns into something
I say don't let me go
And you say why can't we be friends
All night I watch it burn
And you say why can't we be friends
Talk to me and tell me how this one goes
I need a taxi
And it falls and it breaks and it turns into something new
And it falls and it breaks and it turns into something
I say don't let me go
And you say why can't we be friends
All night I watch it burn
And you say why can't we be friends
Talk to me and tell me how this one goes
I need a taxi
